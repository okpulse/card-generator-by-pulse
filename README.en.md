### ➕ Custom background

You don’t have to use the uploaded image strictly as an icon — you can also turn it into a background. To do this:
  - upload the image;
  - set its scale and position (stretch and center it);
  - hide the plate in the plate settings by moving the slider to the right (or stretch it across the screen if you want a brighter image);
  - choose presets or fine‑tune the palette manually.

An example of what you can get:
<img src="./assets/example-background.png" alt="Background" width="800" style="max-width:100%;">

### 🎨 Palette
  - `BG 1` — the top part of the background (the background is set with a three‑stop gradient)
  - `BG 2` — the central part of the background
  - `BG 3` — the bottom part of the background
  - `Text` — the title color
  - `Secondary` — the description color
  - `Accent 1` — the first color of the plate gradient (top‑left)
  - `Accent 2` — the second color of the plate gradient (bottom‑right)
  - `Brand` — the brand/footnote color
